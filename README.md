## Nickel Price Forecasting using Deep Learning LSTM model

Forecasting nickel prices involves using historical data and current market trends to make predictions about future prices. One approach to this is using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, which is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that can capture long-term dependencies in sequential data.

## CRISP data mining
The CRISP (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology is a widely used process model for data mining projects. It consists of six stages, which are:

- Business Understanding: Identify the business problem and the goals of the project.

- Data Understanding: Collect and analyze the data that will be used for the project.

- Data Preparation: Clean and preprocess the data to make it suitable for analysis.

- Modeling: Develop and train the LSTM model on the prepared data.

- Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the model on a separate test dataset.

- Deployment: Deploy the model in the business environment and monitor its performance.
